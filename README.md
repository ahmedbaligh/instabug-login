# Instabug Login

This is a simple app made as a part of [Instabug](https://instabug.com/)'s screening process for their Front-End Internship.

## Overview

This is a responsive app with login mock functionality consisting of 3 pages:

- Login: has a carousel and a login form with the following functionality:

  - Checks if the user's email is valid.
  - Checks if the password is at least 8 characters long, with at least 1 capital letter and 1 number, and that it also does not contain the user's email.
  - Validates the entered email and password via an existing array of users.
  - Redirects to the `/welcome` page when the user logs in, or if they are already logged in.

- Welcome:

  - Greets the user by their email.
  - Redirects to the `/login` page when the user logs out, or if they are not logged in.

- 404:
  - Shows a 404 Not Found error.
  - Any other route, other than `/login` and `/welcome`, will redirect to `/404`.
